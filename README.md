## Project Background

ABC Retail, a rapidly growing online retailer, faced several challenges with its legacy on-premises infrastructure:

- **Order processing:** Relational databases struggled with peak season transaction volume.  
- **Product images:** Stored in network drives, causing slow access times and inefficiency.  
- **Message queuing:** Legacy middleware lacked scalability, resulting in delays and errors.  
- **Data analytics:** On-premises tools could not efficiently process diverse customer data types, leading to delays in actionable insights.  

Despite migrating parts of the system to the cloud, ABC Retail needed a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud solution to handle real-time events, store data efficiently, and enable better analytics.

2. Hosts images and multimedia content with **Azure Blob Storage**.  
3. Handles order processing and inventory management using **Azure Queues**.  
4. Stores dummy contracts using **Azure Files**.  
5. Deploys a fully functional **web application** accessible via an Azure App Service.
