üè¢ Project Background
ABC Retail is a rapidly growing online retailer currently using an aging on-premises order processing system. The company faces several challenges:

Customer orders and product data stored in traditional relational databases struggle to handle high transaction volumes during peak seasons.

Product images are stored in network drives, causing slow access and storage inefficiencies.

Legacy message queuing middleware lacks scalability, causing delays and processing errors.

Data analytics infrastructure cannot efficiently process complex customer data, impacting personalization, recommendations, and operational insights.

The goal of this POE is to design and implement scalable, cloud-based solutions using Microsoft Azure to improve order processing, storage, messaging, and analytics.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Scope & Objectives
The POE consists of 3 parts that progressively build the final solution:

Azure Storage Solution ‚Äì Part 1

Enhanced Functionality and Integration ‚Äì Part 2

Final Deployment and Reflection ‚Äì Part 3

Key Objectives:

Store customer profiles and product information using Azure Tables

Host product images and multimedia content using Azure Blob Storage

Process orders and inventory using Azure Queues

Store contracts and documents using Azure Files

Deploy a web application to Azure App Service

Ensure solutions are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective
